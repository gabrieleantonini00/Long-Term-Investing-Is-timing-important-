# Long-Term-Investing-Is-timing-important-

In this project I analyse if it is convenient to wait for the market to drop 5 or 10 ppts from the maximum instead of investing as soon as the money are available. 

Research Question:

The research question being addressed is:
- Which investment strategy is better for long-term returns:**
  - Random Investment, where the investment is made at a random point in time and held for 10 years.
  - Market Drop Strategy, where you wait for a 5% or 10% drop from the highest price after a random start date and invest at that point, holding the investment for a period adjusted to be 10 years after the random start date (taking into account the cost of waiting).

Summary of the Code:

The code simulates two investment strategies for an S&P 500 ETF over a 10-year period:

1. Random Investment Strategy:
   - A random start date is selected from the available historical data.
   - An investment is made on this random date, and the holding period lasts for exactly 10 years.
   - The total return is calculated based on the change in price over this 10-year period.

2. Market Drop Strategy:
   - A random start date is selected as in the random investment strategy.
   - The maximum price after the random start date is identified.
   - The strategy then waits for a 5% or 10% drop from this peak price, but only after the random start date.
   - The investment is made at this drop date.
   - The investment period is then adjusted to ensure it lasts for exactly 10 years from the random start date, taking into account the cost of waiting.

Conclusion:
- The random investment strategy outperformed the market drop strategies (5% and 10% drops). 
- This suggests that in a long-term upward-trending market, investing randomly can be more effective than trying to time the market by waiting for significant corrections.
- The results imply that waiting for a market drop (whether 5% or 10%) can sometimes lead to missing out on strong market rallies, reducing the overall returns in a bull market.
